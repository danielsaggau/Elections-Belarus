This analysis is devided into numerous sections: 

The first section is data pre-processing.

The subsequent section examines different tools for feature selection, specifically lasso and random forest models. 
Subsequently, we can run a regular OLS regression with the different features.

Thereafter follows a section on topic modeling. 
For the topic models we create one big word corpus.
Based on this corpus we can then build our topic models using various sampling methods, also looking at what features matter most.

# Data 

# Results 


## Random Forest 

## Lasso Regression 

To undertake the lasso model, we need to model our optimal lambda parameter. 

## OLS Regression (RF)
## OLS Regression (LASSO)
